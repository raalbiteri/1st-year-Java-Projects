# 1st-year-Java-Projects
Putting together a group of projects from this past school year @ Milwaukee School of Engineering

1) This is a sample of a Guitar Synthesizer created on our fifth Data Structure Lab. Really turned out to be an
exciting project aside from how difficult it initially sounded.
