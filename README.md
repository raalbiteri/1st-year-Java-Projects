# 1st-year-Java-Projects
Putting together a group of projects from this past school year at Milwaukee School of Engineering. These projects were a culmination
of what was learned in my first two quarters of Software Development alongside an in-depth look into Data Structures.

#1) Guitar Synthesizer
-This is a sample of a Guitar Synthesizer created on our fifth Data Structure Lab practicing with Queues. Really turned out to be an
exciting project aside from how difficult it initially sounded.

#2) Morse Decoder
-This is a sample of a Morse Decoder created on our seventh Data Structure Lab practicing with recursion. Took some time understanding the recursive aspect of this project but it was actually quite simple.

#3) Connect the Dots Generator
-This is a sample of a reduced connect the dots generator created on our second Data Structure Lab practicing with the Big O time
complexity of Lists compared to Collections. Probably one of the more difficult of our labs but nevertheless got everything working
properly and as efficient as possible for a first year student.
