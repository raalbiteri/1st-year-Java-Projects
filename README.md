# 1st-year-Java-Projects
Putting together a group of projects from this past school year @ Milwaukee School of Engineering

#1) Guitar Synthesizer
-This is a sample of a Guitar Synthesizer created on our fifth Data Structure Lab. Really turned out to be an
exciting project aside from how difficult it initially sounded.

#2) Morse Decoder
-This is a sample of a Morse Decoder created on our seventh Data Structure Lab. Took some time understanding the 
recursive aspect of this project but it was actually quite simple.
